IEEE Vis 2020 solicits submissions in a short paper format. Short papers draw from the same paper types and topics as full papers of VAST, Infovis and Scivis, ranging from theoretical to applied research contributions. 

Short papers welcome submissions describing original work with focused and concise research contributions, incremental work such as follow-up extensions or evaluations of existing methods, or exploratory work.   

The short paper submission deadline is June 13, 2020, creating an opportunity to showcase late-breaking research results. This deadline is one week after the June 6 notification for conditional acceptance of full papers, enabling the distillation and focused expression of work that otherwise might not be part of VIS.  

### Submission Guidelines:

Short papers can be up to four pages plus up to one page of references. Submissions will be in the VGTC conference two-column format, in line with the [IEEE VIS formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html).


### Publication Details:
Accepted short papers will be presented at the VIS conference. They will also be included in the conference proceedings and published in IEEE Xplore and assigned a DOI.  

Authors of accepted short papers may subsequently submit to TVCG (the journal, not to the VIS conference) a full paper on the same topic, consistent with the TVCG standard of asking for “more than 30 percent new material and insights” compared to a previous conference paper.

Concurrent submissions of short papers and posters are not possible.

### Important Dates:

* Submission Deadline: **June 13, 2020**
* Notification: **July 18, 2020**
* Submission of Camera-Ready Final Version: **August 1, 2020**

All deadlines are at **5:00pm Pacific Time (PDT)**.
